## Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important and we take is seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we use any personal information about you that is collected or generated through your use of the _Mini-TMQ_ web application ("the App").

The App is accessed via [teamquest.uivraeus.net](https://teamquest.uivraeus.net) and is operated by _uivraeus_ ("we", "our", "us"). Please refer to the [Contact](/contact) page for how to reach out to us.
>Note that this version of _Mini-TMQ_ is only used for test and evaluation purposes. Account information and data collected may be deleted at any moment, without prior notice. See the [Terms and Conditions of Use](/terms) for further details.

## Principle of anonymous data {:#anon-principles}
In principle the App can be used without providing personal data. The main function of the App is to collect and process answers to a set of survey question, but the individuals who provide these answers don't authenticate themselves via login or by other means. This is possible because all answers are stored and made available without any record of _who_ provided them. 

Because of this, we do not classify the answers in survey responses as "personal data" (according to [Article 4 (1) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/)). This is important as we make the survey results available without any access restrictions.

This anonymisation of survey data also means that it is not possible to remove or modify answers provided by a specific individual, as it is not possible to know which database records (if any) to operate on.

### Anonymous identifiers
A specific survey run (instance) is identified by a random (non-secret) identifier which is used when collecting and storing the answers. From this identifier it is possible, via an associated _team identifier_, to relate the specific instance to other survey instances, which is required for calculating and presenting trends over time.

The team identifier, which is also random and openly disclosed, doesn't tell anything about the individuals that are, or have been part of, the team. In fact, no such information is maintained in any part of the App or its underlying services and databases.


### General notes on Internet anonymity
When you access our App (or any other website), some information, such as your IP address, is transferred. You are also providing information about the your device (computer, smartphone, tablet etc.) and your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.). In addition, other information is given or can be derived such as time and duration of visit etc.

We cannot use this data to identify an individual user but, via our service providers, this type of information can be used to derive aggregated statistics on how our App is used and if there are performance or stability issues for certain groups of users. To some extent it may also be used to implement or secure specific functions. Read more about this in the [Third Party Providers](#third-party-providers) section below.

Please bear in mind that in the case of a _static IP address_, personal identification is possible by RIPE query in individual cases, although we do not perform this. Our App is accessible for both static and dynamically assigned IP addresses.

## How we use survey data
Although the survey answers are not considered as personal data we still think it is important for us to be transparent about how the data we collect may be used.

The most direct usage of the data is what we present within the App itself such as team maturity results.

We may also use the collected anonymous survey data in private or academic research. 

## Collection and processing of personal data for all users {:#data-all-users}
This section applies to _all_ types of users of the App, those that are anonymous as well as those logged in.

For operations and maintenance purposes we, or our service providers, collect and process the following data transferred from your browser:

* IP address
  * Necessary for presentation of the App on your device.
  * May also be used for profiling of usage trends and cataloging of error reports.
* User-agent data (e.g. browser type and version)
  * May be used for profiling of usage trends and cataloging of error reports.
* Device manufacturer and model (e.g. iPhone version)
  * May be used for profiling of usage trends and cataloging of error reports.

The data listed above is required for technical purposes in order to show you our content, process input and guarantee stability and security. The legal basis is a legitimate interest in accordance with [Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/). As this data is imperative for the operation of the App, users may not object to this.

If you contact us via e-mail, as described on the [Contact](/contact) page, we will keep records of this communication, including any information you share with us in those e-mails, as long as it serves a business purpose.

More details on where information is stored and maintained can be found in the [Third Party Providers](#third-party-providers) section below.

## Additional collection and processing of personal data for logged in users
For users that create an account and _log in_ to access the various survey- and team administration functions, what is described in in [the section for all users](#data-all-users) is still valid. In _addition_ to that, the following also applies. 

### Registering an account
To be able to _initiate_ surveys for your team(s), you have to register an account via an automatic sign-up process. For this purpose you specify the following information that we will collect and process as personal data:
* e-mail address
* password

This will be your credentials for subsequent logins to the App. 

### Managing teams and surveys
Each survey created by you will be associated to a _team_. So, for each registered user we will collect and process as personal data:
* Defined team(s)

As an owner of a team, you will give it a _name_ but publicly, e.g. when any _other user_ of the App views results and trends for the team, an anonymous (random) identifier is used. Other users will not have access to information on which (or the number of) teams that are defined and associated with your registered account.

### Terminating your account {:#termination}
If you want to terminated (delete) your account you can do this from within the App itself. You don't have to contact us separately for that. The only requirement is that you can prove ownership of the account by entering your normal login credentials.

When the account is deleted, all personal data stored for this account will be deleted from our databases and services. In addition, all associations to (anonymous) team-identifiers and survey data are removed. Aggregated survey data, i.e. anonymous answers from you and others, may still be retained but without anything linking it to your deleted account.

>The service providers we use in our infrastructure may retain data, or backups of it, for a limited period of time also after we have requested its removal via our App. Read more about this in the [Third Party Providers](#third-party-providers) section below.

## Storage of your personal data
We aim to store most of our data in the European Economic Area (EEA) when feasible. However, we do use some service providers who are based outside the EEA. In these circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to the United States (US) if the service provider ensures similar protection to personal data, for example by using the European Commissionâ€™s standard contractual clauses or in accordance with the Privacy Shield Framework.

## Securing your personal data
We take precautions to protect your personal information. Communication between your browser and any of our services is secured using HTTPS through a TLS Certificate, aka. "SSL", which ensures encryption of all data being sent.

The external services we rely on in our application infrastructure have been chosen with security in mind to minimize the risk of data breaches. This includes encryption of stored data associated to your account if you are a registered user.

We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.

## Transfer of your personal data to third parties
We rely on third party service providers in our application infrastructure and, when necessary for the function and operation of the App, personal data may be shared with those providers (see [Third Party Providers](#third-party-providers) section below).

We do not sell your personal information to others but we may disclose or share it if required to comply with any legal, regulatory or tax obligation.

If we wish to use your personal information for a purpose beyond that for which it was originally provided, we will ask for your consent or seek to rely on another valid legal ground to process your personal information in accordance with the applicable law.

## Third Party Providers {:#third-party-providers}
We will share your personal information with our service providers who act as our data _processors_ (for which we are _controllers_). Some of our service providers may use further sub-processors.
